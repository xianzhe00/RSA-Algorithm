Instructions to run RSA.java
1)Compile the program.
2)Select file to be encrypted by entering filename. Ex: RSA-test.txt
3)Encryption and decryption is done and files are created. (encryptedContent.txt) & (decryptedContent.txt)
4)To re-run the program, please clear the content of the text files as I implemented the writing function without append method.
